In the two chapters of "Born a crime by Trevor" we get into  the life of Trevor a child growing up during apartheid in South Africa raised by a strict christian mother .
        Trevor tells the tale of his mother's steadfast faith and the difficulties they had faced due to the racial and apartheid times brought by apartheid.This  first chapter highlights the tribal conflicts between Zulu and Xhosa tribes.Being raised in a christian household,Trevor is still not  convinced that they should got to church each and every sunday.On the other hand, Trevor’s mother is governed by church and she wouldn't by any of Trevor’s excuses to don’t got to church.Trevor’s mother is determined to keep her son safe even if it means throwing him out of a moving car to save him from gang attack.
        Trevor was born to a white father and a black mother,which that union was illegal at that time.This chapter shows the cruelty of apartheid as Trevor’s existence was considered a crime.The apartheid and its oppressive laws brought injustices.
        Connecting this issues to my county Narok,Its clear while the specific circumstances may differ,the theme of resilience in the face of misfortune are unversal.In Narok we also grapple with issues of water scarcity,climate change and land issues ,for instance ,mirroring the systemic injustices Trevor describes in his book.y there is different groups of people divided by church.Also in church relations there in my county there is interest of rich and average people’s church.
