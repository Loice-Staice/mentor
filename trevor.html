            In the two chapters of "Born a Crime by Trevor" we get into the life of Trevor a child growing up during apartheid in South Africa raised by a strict Christian mother.
        Trevor tells the tale of his mother's steadfast faith and the difficulties they had faced due to the racial and apartheid times brought by apartheid. This first chapter highlights the tribal conflicts between the Zulu and Xhosa tribes. Being raised in a Christian household, Trevor is still not convinced that they should go to church every Sunday. On the other hand, Trevor’s mother is governed by church and she wouldn't buy any of Trevor’s excuses to don’t go to church. Trevor’s mother is determined to keep her son safe even if it means throwing him out of a moving car to save him from a gang attack.
        Trevor was born to a white father and a black mother, and that union was illegal at that time. This chapter shows the cruelty of apartheid as Trevor’s existence was considered a crime. The apartheid and its oppressive laws brought injustices.
        Connecting this issue to my county Narok, it's clear while the specific circumstances may differ, the theme of resilience in the face of misfortune is universal. In Narok we also grapple with issues of water scarcity, climate change, and land issues, for instance, mirroring the systemic injustices Trevor describes in his book. There are different groups of people divided by church. Also in church relations in my county, there is interest in rich and average people’s churches.
